Ban On Death is a plugin that enables you to ban players on death, customize the length of the bans, and even the messages they receive for their failure! Whether, it's 5 seconds, or 5 hours, they're not getting back on until their time is up! (Unless of course, you're feeling nice and want to manually unban them.)

Version 2.2.1 is now up!

Features

Length of Bans can now be specified in the config.
Players see how much longer they're banned for when they try logging in.
Bans continue to count down, even while the server is offline(as long as server is shut down with the stop command).
Permissions support.
Commands.
Customize the message players receive upon dying.
Lives!
Commands

/bod ban <username> : Bans the specified player for the duration specified in the configuration. Currently, adding arguments to specify the ban's length is not supported. This will hopefully be added in an future release.
/bod unban <username> : Unbans the specified player from their temporary ban, allowing them back onto the server. As of version 2.1(MC 1.2.5), all is no longer accepted as an argument.
/bod god <username> :Makes the specified player invincible to all damage. If you do not specify a player, the player entering the command will become invincible.
/bod info <username> : Returns how much time a player has left in a ban OR how many lives they have remaining. It'll only display lives remaining when the player is not currently banned. Make sure to remember that players' lives only reset on login(after a specified number of days) for the sake of being lightweight.
/bod give <username> <amount>: Gives the specified player additional lives.
/bod take <username> <amount>: Removes specified amount of lives from specified player.
/bod set <username> <amount>: Sets the amount of lives of the specified player to the specified amount.
/bod reset <username> :  Resets the specified player's lives based on their tier.  If the player is offline, they will be reset upon the next time they join.
/bod lives : Returns how many lives the user who typed the command in has remaining. Currently there is no permission node for this command.

Although I'm not required to by this license, I figured I'd upload the source code anyway. As a warning however, I don't use a lot of standing coding procedure, and am heavily self taught. The same is even more true for Github, so bear with me.
